# Project: Neighborhood Map

## About
This is the fifth project of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. It is a Single Page Application _(SPA)_ with an interactive map containing info about my favorite Japanese restaurants in Barcelona. 

The goal for this project was to practice and learn about: **AJAX requests**, using **3rd Party APIs**, **Javascript Design Patterns**, using **Organization Libraries** (like _Knockout.js_) and the **Google Maps Javascript API**.

Following is Udacity's description for this project:

>*You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).*
